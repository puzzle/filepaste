Welcome to Filepaste

Filepaste is a tool to share files in- or outside your companie.
It is like a multiuser clipboard for your data.

Filepaste is written with rails, so it is easy to setup.

  it with gems:

    sudo gem install rails --include-dependencies
    sudo gem update --system

    git clone git://github.com/puzzle/filepaste.git

  Now edit the database configuration, rails need to know where to
  store the data :

    vim config/settings.yml

  command to start the mongrel server:
